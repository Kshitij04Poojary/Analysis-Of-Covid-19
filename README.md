**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

In this project, PyTorch is used to create and train a ResNet-18 model and apply it to a dataset of chest X-ray data. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. My objective in this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.

**PROJECT STRUCTURE**

This project is divided into the following tasks:

- Task 1: Introduction
- Task 2: Importing Libraries
- Task 3: Creating Custom Dataset
- Task 4: Image Transformations
- Task 5: Prepare DataLoader
- Task 6: Data Visualization
- Task 7: Creating the Model
- Task 8: Training the Model
- Task 9: Final Results

An accuracy of 96.67 was obtained
